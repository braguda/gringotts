MicePace, a social media web application!

A full stack web application that was built with HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Bootstrap, EJS templating, MongoDB, Mongoose, Node.JS, Express, and features Cloudinary, JOI, and many more fun things!

This applications goes through CRUD operations for its posts and comment features. This is only the base version. As I learn and grom my skillset, I will periodically come back and launch updates to this application. The next feature in the works is a call to the giphy API so users can use gifs to add more personality to their posts and comments. Come check it out!
